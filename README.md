# Klasse

This is a monorepo of project Klasse

> Cito launches Klasse, a cooperative game for secondary education classes. Your students play this 'escape room-like' game in a race against the clock. Because the solution must be entered within 30 minutes. In the meantime, the teacher can observe how their students work together.

This repository contains the source code for the theme site [https://klasse.cito.nl/](https://klasse.cito.nl/)

For technical documentation see readme in the frontend and backend folder
