# Klasse

This is a monorepo of project Klasse

```
Cito launches Klasse, a cooperative game for secondary education classes. Your students play this 'escape room-like' game in a race against the clock. Because the solution must be entered within 30 minutes. In the meantime, the teacher can observe how their students work together.
